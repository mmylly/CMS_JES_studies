The file in this folder allows for pThat weighting. Here are the installation instructions:

After installing Pythia 6 using R. Hatcher's script:
1) remove pyevwt.o and pyrand.o from pythia6/v6_428/src and
2) remove all in pythia6/v6_428/lib (the place where libPythia6.so is).
3) Throw the file in this folder into pythia6/v6_428/src
4) run R. Hatcher's script again. 

N.B. Linking this installation with ROOT requires care!
     If ROOT is installed with cmake, introduce the pythia6 path variable
     (see cmake commands and variables in the ROOT webpages).
