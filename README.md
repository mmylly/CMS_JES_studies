Code for handling monte carlo generators
========================================

See INSTALL for further instructions for setting up the environment.

TODO
====

- Flavour analysis has to be fixed, this was modified to get QCDAware working
- Herwig 7 has not been tested properly yet
- POWHEG and Madgraph maybe needing attention, this is difficult and time-consuming
- Sherpa; no flat tuples are possible so this has to be done in a sliced format
