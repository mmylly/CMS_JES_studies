The program gpythia6 outputs TTrees to the same folder it is under. For 
clarity, move the output trees manually to saved_outputs further analysis.

gpythia 6 usage:
first make the gpythia6 target in the gen_handle folder:
	cd /home/toni/work/CMS/gen_handle
	make gpythia6
after make, gpythia6 may be invoke at
	/home/toni/work/CMS/gen_handle/greedy_pythia6
by calling
	./gpythia6.exe [Number of events] (mode) (threads)
Where modes are:
0: generic
1: dijet
2: gammajet
3: Zjet
4: ttbarjet
        
Example to generate 1000 dijet events with nameId 8 (affects choice of random seed, choose between 1<=nameId<=10):
	./gpythia6.exe 1000 1 8

Command sandbox:
./gpythia6.exe 2000000 1 1


! HOX !
THERE ARE FLAGS TO BE AWARE OF, CHECK TO VETO IF NEED BE:
1) NON-b-CONTAINING EVENTS (search for "uncomment")
2) Events with too many jets (in JetLoop)
ALWAYS MAKE SURE THEY ARE SET AS SHOULD
